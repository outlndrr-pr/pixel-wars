# How to Fix Styling Issues in Production

If your UI changes aren't appearing in the production build even after successful deployment, here are some steps to troubleshoot and fix the issues:

## 1. Clear Browser Cache

The most common issue is browser caching. Try:
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Opening the site in an incognito/private window
- Clearing your browser cache completely

## 2. Fix CSS Loading

Make sure the CSS is properly loading:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to the "Network" tab
3. Refresh the page
4. Look for any CSS files that failed to load (marked in red)
5. Check the "Console" tab for any CSS-related errors

## 3. Clear Next.js Cache

Sometimes Next.js cache can cause issues:

```bash
# Stop any running processes
# Then run:
rm -rf .next
npm run build
npm run start
```

## 4. Fix Theme Detection

The app uses dark/light mode which might not be detecting correctly:

```jsx
// Check app/layout.tsx to ensure it has:
<html lang="en" className="light">
  {/* or force dark mode with: */}
  {/* <html lang="en" className="dark"> */}
```

## 5. Vercel Environment Variables

Make sure Vercel has the correct environment variables:
1. Go to the Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Settings" > "Environment Variables"
4. Verify all required environment variables are set correctly

## 6. Forced Redeploy

Try a forced redeploy on Vercel:
1. Go to your project on Vercel
2. Navigate to the "Deployments" tab
3. Find your latest deployment
4. Click the three dots menu (...)
5. Select "Redeploy" without cache

## 7. Firebase Authentication Domain

If you're seeing cross-origin or CSP errors:
1. Go to the Firebase Console
2. Navigate to "Authentication" > "Settings" > "Authorized Domains"
3. Add your Vercel domain: `pixel-pqtnsvfbm-outlndrrs-projects.vercel.app`
4. Add any other deployment domains or preview URLs you use

## 8. Checking Component Integration

Make sure components are properly imported and rendered:
1. Check for console errors that might indicate component problems
2. Verify that your Card components are being imported from the correct location
3. Add some debugging to ensure components are rendering:

```jsx
console.log('Rendering Card component with:', props);
```

## Need more help?

If you're still experiencing issues, create a specific test page (e.g., `/test`) that only includes basic components to isolate the problem.
